# Digit-Prediction
To perform digit prediction, the first step is to preprocess the image of the digit. This can involve techniques such as resizing, normalization, and grayscale conversion, which help to standardize the input format and reduce the impact of noise or variations in the image.

Once the image has been preprocessed, it is then passed through a deep neural network model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are particularly well-suited for digit prediction tasks because they are able to learn and recognize patterns in the image data.

The CNN model is typically trained on a large dataset of labeled digit images, such as the MNIST dataset. During training, the model learns to recognize features in the input images that are associated with each numerical digit value. These features might include things like the curvature of the lines in the digit, the thickness of the strokes, or the presence of specific patterns or shapes.

Once the model has been trained, it can be used to predict the numerical value of a new input digit image. This is done by passing the preprocessed image through the trained model, which generates a probability distribution over the possible numerical digit values. The predicted digit is then typically taken as the digit value with the highest probability.

Digit prediction has many practical applications, including optical character recognition (OCR), automated sorting of mail or packages, and digit recognition in security system
